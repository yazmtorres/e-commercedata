<h1> e-commerce consumers </h1>
<p>The data on this project reveals consumer behavior from a small e-commerce site. This data is for November 2018, though a bit outdated it leads us in the direction of exploring patterns in online consumer behavior. The data includes the following columns, [date, customer_id, product_category, payment_method, value, time_on_site, clicks_in_site]. We are asking the questions: How long are consumers spending on the shopping website? And, is the user making the purchase? This was completed as part of Code Louisville Data 1 Analysis course.</p>
